# File Objects

##The Basics:
# f = open("test.txt", "r") #read
# f = open("test.txt", "w") #write
# f = open("test.txt", "a") #append
# f = open("test.txt", "r+") #read write
# print(f.name)
# print(f.mode)
# f.close()

##Reading Files: w/ context manager
with open("test.txt", "r") as f:
    pass

##Small Files:
f_contents = f.read()
print(f_contents)

##Big Files: returns list of lines
f_contents = f.readlines()
print(f_contents)

###With the extra lines: #first line, second line..
f_contents = f.readline()
print(f_contents)
f_contents = f.readline()
print(f_contents)

###Without the extra lines:
f_contents = f.readline()
print(f_contents)
f_contents = f.readline()
print(f_contents)

###Iterating through the file:
for line in f:
    print(line)

###Going Back....:
f_contents = f.read()
print(f_contents)

###Printing by characters:
f_contents = f.read(100)
print(f_contents)
f_contents = f.read(100)
print(f_contents)
f_contents = f.read(100)
print(f_contents)

###Iterating through small chunks:
size_to_read = 100
f_contents = f.read(size_to_read)
while len(f_contents) > 0:
    print(f_contents)
    f_contents = f.read(size_to_read)

###Iterating through small chunks, with 10 characters:
size_to_read = 10
f_contents = f.read(size_to_read)
print(f_contents)
f.seek(0) #change current position
f_contents = f.read(size_to_read)
print(f_contents)
print(f.tell()) #at position 10
while len(f_contents) > 0:
    print(f_contents)
    f_contents = f.read(size_to_read)
    print(f.mode)
    print(f.closed)
    print(f.read())


##Writing Files:
###The Error:
# with open("test.txt", "r") as f:
# f.write("Test")

###Writing Starts:
# with open("test2.txt", "w") as f:
# pass
# f.write("Test")
# f.seek(0)
# f.write("Test")
# f.seek("R")

##Copying Files:
# with open("test.txt", "r") as rf:
# with open("test_copy.txt", "w") as wf:
# for line in rf:
# wf.write(line)

# Copying the/your image:
###The Error
# with open("bronx.jpg", "r") as rf:
# with open("bronx_copy.jpg", "w") as wf:
# for line in rf:
# wf.write(line)

###Copying the image starts, without chunks:
# with open("bronx.jpg", "rb") as rf:
# with open("bronx_copy.jpg", "wb") as wf:
# for line in rf:
# wf.write(line)

###Copying the image with chunks:
# with open("bronx.jpg", "rb") as rf:
# with open("bronx_copy.jpg", "wb") as wf:
# chunk_size = 4096
# rf_chunk = rf.read(chunk_size)
# while len(rf_chunk) > 0:
# wf.write(rf_chunk)
# rf_chunk = rf.read(chunk_size)
